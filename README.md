# cudaMandlebrot
Uses the graphics card to generate a greyscale mandlebrot zoom. Written in CUDA C++

If there is a folder called "renders" in the current working directory, then a series of .ppm images will be produced with the results of the zoom.

Either way, an text-based preview will be shown in the console while the program is working.
